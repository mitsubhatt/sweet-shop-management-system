# SugarCoded â€” The Sweet Shop

A minimal sweet shop system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following a test-driven development (TDD) approach.

## About the Project

This is a simple UI layer for a sweet shop inventory system, built as part of the Incubyte TDD assessment. The core logic and test cases are implemented in JavaScript using TDD practices. This UI demonstrates the basic functionalities like adding, deleting, and viewing sweets.

> The real flavor (logic + tests) is in the codebase. The Ui is just for basic add and delete :)
