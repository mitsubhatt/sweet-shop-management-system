# My reflection on TDD through Sweet Shop Management System 

This project helped me understand the real value of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. It was my first time working in TDD and this was the perfect opportunity to explore and learn it.
I followed the process of writing tests first using **Jest**, then building logic to make them pass. This helped me think through edge cases and write cleaner, more reliable code.

I implemented test coverage for key features like:
- Adding, deleting, updating sweets
- Preventing duplicates
- Searching, sorting, and quantity validations

Once all tests passed, I built a minimal UI using HTML, CSS, and JS to demonstrate the features interactively.

Overall, this project improved my confidence in writing testable code and strengthened my approach to clean logic design.
Thank you.
